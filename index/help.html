<p>Hey, I'm Faith and I'll be giving you some advice that you can try to help yourself with stress, education, low self asteem or a low mood.</p>
<p>Everyone has days where they don't feel good or they don't like how they are being treated or how they look, and no one is alone for feeling like that.<br> But some times it is hard to tell a bad day from something more so here are some things you can do to see if you are having a bad day or are dealing with something else.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat some breakfast, furit, ceral, pancakes, waffles, toast, eggs and everything in bettween will make for a good meal to help you gain back some energy.</li>
<li>Take some time to do some health care like A shower, a bath, brush your teeth, do your hair, play around with make up, pain your nails, get a hair cut, exsorsise to a reasonable amount, these can help you relax and add to your self confedance a bit.</li>
<li>Focus on something that you are interested in. People have many different interests and looking on places like Pintrest or even looking up "crafts" on google immages can give you some pretty cool ideas to try.</li>
</ul>

<p>From my Long and harsh research I have found some videos that have helped me when I was to stressed to function and they helped clear some things up for me, I hope some work for you too.</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpg3gtwepSs" target="_blank">A Song</a>
  
 <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJI2L8l1Ymc" target="_blank">Video about weight</a>
   
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmMByS-lEbI" target="_blank"> Video about anger issues</a>
</ul>
<p>Now everything on this page will not work for everyone but I do hope that this has helped atleast a little. I hope you enjoy the rest of Ludopy and have a great day! -Faith L. of Ludopy</p>
